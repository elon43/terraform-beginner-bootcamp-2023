    <h1>Football Video Games</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Football video games have been a favorite pastime for sports enthusiasts for many years. These games allow fans to step into the shoes of their favorite football players, coaches, and teams. Whether you want to score the winning touchdown, manage a team, or engage in epic virtual matches, there's a football video game for you.</p>
        <p>Two football video games I enjoyed in my early teen years were Techmo Bowl and Cyberball.</p>
        
        <h2>Techmo Bowl</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Release Date 1989:</strong> Techmo Bowl was played on the Nintendo game system.  It was the first console game to include real NFL players.</li>
            <li><strong>Playbook:</strong> The playbook only consisted of four offensive plays.  Two of those plays were run plays and the other two were pass playes.  As far as defense, you tried to guess which of the 4 offensive plays your oppenent was going to choose.  If the defense selected the correct play, your chances of stopping the run, sacking the quarterback, or getting an interception increases significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Teams:</strong> There were only a total of 12 teams.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Cyberball</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Release Date 1988:</strong> Cyberball was released as an arcade game.  It used robotic avatars as football players.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Modifications:</strong> The game used an explosive ball that transitioned from cool to warm, hot, and critical status before exploiding.  The robots would explode if they got too tired.  It was a very entertaining game.</li>
