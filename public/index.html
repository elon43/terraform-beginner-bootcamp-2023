        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease and flour a 10-inch (25 cm) tube pan or bundt pan.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove it from the pan and place it on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle with a simple glaze if desired.</li>
        </ol>
